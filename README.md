# StructuralEngineering
This project seeks to build an open list of tools, libraries on Structural Engineering: the objective of this project is to organize all available resources on the topic in one environment, making it easier to search for tools.

## Section Properties

[Section Properties](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/section-properties) is a rich library written in Python for material mechanics. It implements analysis of any section using the finite element method

## Concrete Properties

[Concrete Properties](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties) is a rich library written in Python with a focus on reinforced concrete, Prestressed Sections, steel concrete composite sections. This library models sections with their geometric and physical properties, implementing detailed graphical views of stresses, bending moments, deformations, etc.
