# StructuralEngineering
This project seeks to build an open list of tools, libraries on Structural Engineering: the objective of this project is to organize all available resources on the topic in one environment, making it easier to search for tools.

## Section Properties

[Section Properties](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/section-properties) is a rich library written in Python for material mechanics. It implements analysis of any section using the finite element method

## Concrete Properties

[Concrete Properties](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/concrete-properties) is a rich library written in Python with a focus on reinforced concrete, Prestressed Sections, steel concrete composite sections. This library models sections with their geometric and physical properties, implementing detailed graphical views of stresses, bending moments, deformations, etc.

### Supports standards
- Australian standard AS 3600:2018
- New Zealand concrete design standard NZS3101:2006

### Features
- [x] Biaxial Bending Moment
- [x] Moment Curvature Response
- [x] Stress Analysis
- [x] Support .dxf
- [ ] Material Database

## Symbeam

[Symbeam](https://github.com/amcc1996/symbeam) is a library written in Python for educational purposes. The library models simple or continuous beams with different loading situations. The module has a plot of the bending moment, shear force and displacement of the element.

## Pystra

[Pystra](https://github.com/pystra/pystra?tab=readme-ov-file) is a library written in Python focused on structural reliability. The library has the most used methods for determining the design point, such as FOSM, FORM, Monte Carlo and SORM. Provide easy implementation of limit states and analyses, in addition to rich documentation and theory

### Features
- [x] FORM
- [x] FOSM
- [x] SORM
- [x] Monte Carlo
- [ ] Plot

The only disadvantage of the lib is the lack of native plots. Libs written in mathlab focuses on reliability have natively plots of the number of iterations in FORM and Monte Carlo, in addition to other graphs

## PyNite

[PyNite](https://github.com/JWock82/PyNite?tab=readme-ov-file) is one of the most complete libraries written in Python for structure analysis. The module features analyzes in the 2d and 3d plane of linear, planar elements. Also provide load combinations, stability analysis and visualization of results and models (supports 3D)

### Features
- [x] 3D structure analysis
- [x] Plane analysis
- [x] Load combinations


## Pycba

[Pycba](https://github.com/ccaprani/pycba?tab=readme-ov-file) is a library focused on continuous beam analysis. The lib has a module dedicated to bridge analysis, including analysis of Critical Values and Positions, vehicle dataset, etc.

### Supports standards
- Australian standard AS 5100

### Features
- [x] Moving Load
- [x] Envelopes
- [x] Influence Lines

### STM
[STM](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/martgrah/stm) is a library focused on strut and tie analysis
